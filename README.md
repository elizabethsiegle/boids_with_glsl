Ok it compiles, but it's not running the code that should be  running. It's running old code, but
it should (we're using code for hw3 that works, and the boids move, and the cube is positioned better,
and we can change views, but this code is running an old version despite this and we're not sure why.)
Hanna worked on the boids and the list, and Lizzie worked on the view switching and shaders, but we
did overlap and plan better. Although it's been tough this last night because of this unexpected plot
twist which has kept us up and busy.)

The matrix and vertex operations should work, but we had trouble compiling both C and C++ files and should
have done that part sooner, but were so focused on getting homework 3 up and running (at least
compiling.)

I know this is a problem in the Makefile but I can't figure out why. We will continue working on
it with more sleep this weekend, but our boids really can/should fly and can switch views.
