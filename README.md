Flying 3D boids with OpenGL. Exit with "Q" or "esc". Change the perspective view with "v", "t", or "s". Change the boid step with "space", and move the target goal with any of the arrow keys. Speed up the boids with "u" or "d", and pause the simulation with "p." Add a boid with "+", take away a boid with "-".
