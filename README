This program is run by typing in "make hw5" followed by "./hw5". Like homework 5, this program just returns a white window (at least no seg faults! We got those!) We worked a lot on comparing and getting the shaders to be like lab 6, which we have running fine, but still are working on the order of calling shader calls, like glBindVertexArray, and what parameters to pass in. Again, I will work on it more tomorrow night when I SSH in from home, but will be 3 hours behind :P
